# Risks of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Exposure Through Marine Fish Consumption

---
This repository contains the data and code used in the study "`Risks of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance (PFAS) Exposure Through Marine Fish Consumption`".

# Contents
- **Daily intake**: Input data, output data and used to calculate the estimated daily intake of PFAS by populations under both the ‘trade’ and ‘no-trade’ scenarios.
- **PFAS concentration in ocean**
- **PFAS in marine fish**:
    - **Food Web Modeling:** Input data, output data, and code used to predict PFAS concentrations in marine fish at a spatial resolution of 1°×1° latitude/longitude.
    - **BAF Modeling**: Modeling data, output data, and code for training a Random Forest (RF) model to estimate the Bioaccumulation Factors (BAFs) of various PFAS in marine species, at a resolution of 1°×1° latitude/longitude.
